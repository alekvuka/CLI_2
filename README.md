# CLI2

The CLI_2 gem is a template for scraping provider information from a health clinic and organizing that
information into obects so that a user can easely interrogate the collected information. In this particular
example, the gem scrapes a list of providers from a health clicic and takes into account each provider's
team, name, specialty, languages and qualifications. The user interacts with the program through a CLI where they
are able to organze providers based on team/soecialty/langues/etc.
